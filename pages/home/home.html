    <h4>APP DESCRIPTION:</h4>
    <p>
      Curious about the supposedly ideal weight of someone your sex and height? Then, Calcuweight, which is brought to you by G9 Developers, is the app for you. In solving your ideal weight, the app uses four different formulas, namely by Hamwi(1964), Devine (1974), Robinson (1983), and Miller (1983) based on your sex and height. Unfortunately, the formulas are only <b>accurate for adults whose height is 5 feet and above</b> and not for kids and pregnant women. To start computing or to learn more on the formulas, visit the calculator page. To learn more about the app or developers, visit the about page.</p></div>
