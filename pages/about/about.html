    <p>Hey there! I'm Andrew and I'm the Lead Programmer of this App. I'm currently a Grade 12 student in La Salle Green Hills under Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) strand. Creating this app was very fun for me so I hope this brings joy in you as well. When using the app, don't dwell much if your weight isn't ideal based on calculations. Just remember to keep a healthy living and everything will come into place.</p>
