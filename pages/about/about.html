    <h5>PETER ANDREW A. MAGPANTAY</h5>
    <p>Hey there! I'm Andrew and I'm the Lead Programmer of Calcuweight. I'm currently a Grade 12 student in La Salle Green Hills (LSGH) under Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) strand. Creating this app was very fun for me so I hope this brings joy in you as well. If your weight isn't ideal based on calculations, don't dwell much on this fact. Just constantly remind yourself to live healthily and when you do so, everything will come into place.</p>

    <p>Hallo! I'm Max and I'm a programmer of this app. Just like Andrew, I'm also a student in LSGH at the same grade and strand. Making this app was really fun and productive at the same time. This was really useful for me since I'm on the <i>heavy side</i> and I wanted to know what my ideal weight should be. But don't worry, if your weight is not even close with your ideal weight, use this as a motivation to stay healthy.</p>

    <p>Blessed day! I am Nathan, an assistant programer of the app and a student-athlete at LSGH, also grade 12 under the STEM strand. The development of the app was very promity since it wil bring awareness to peoples weight and health. I am sure this app will help countless of people with their weight loss or gain journey. As an athlete, weight is very important to my day to day life but it doesn't define who I am. Do not let not getting the ideal weight drive you to losing hope. Instead,  remember that a healthy life will surely bring happiness to you.</p>
