		THE APP
	</h1>
	<div class="app">
		<p>Calcuweight is an application that helps you easily compute for your ideal weight based on on your height and sex using four different formulas. It was coded using <a href="https://stackblitz.com/">StackBlitz</a>, an online coding software.</p>
		<h3>So, how does it work? </h3>
		<h4>Step 1: Indicate what your sex and height is. </h4>
		<p class="inst">It is important to know your sex and height because the formulas are different for each sex and will depend
			on your height. In this app, we only take height values in feet and inches. Take note that height values
			shouldn’t be negative or the inches value shouldn’t be greater than or equal to 12. Please convert 12 inches
			to 1 foot.</p>
		<h4>Step 2: Press Solve.</h4>
		<p class="inst">After inputting your sex and height, simply press the green “Solve” button and the app will automatically
			compute your weight.</p>
		<h4>Step 3: Tada! You can see your ideal weight.</h4>
		<p class="inst">The app will indicate four values on what your ideal weight is depending on which formula was used. This is
			summarized at the bottom of the calculator, just below solve button.</p>

		<h5>PETER ANDREW A. MAGPANTAY</h5>
		<p class="mes">Hey there! I'm Andrew and I'm the Lead Programmer of Calcuweight. I'm currently a Grade 12 student in La
			Salle Green Hills (LSGH) under Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) strand. Creating this
			app was very fun for me so I hope this brings joy in you as well. If your weight isn't ideal based on
			calculations, don't dwell much on this fact. Just constantly <b>remind yourself to live healthily</b> and
			when you do so, <i>everything</i> will come into place.</p>

		<p class="mes">Hallo! I'm Max and I'm a programmer of this app. Just like Andrew, I'm also a student in LSGH at the same
			grade and strand. Making this app was really fun and productive at the same time. This was really useful for
			me since I'm on the <i>heavy side</i> and I wanted to know what my ideal weight should be. But don't worry,
			if your weight is not even close with your ideal weight, <b>use this as a motivation to stay healthy.</b>

		<p class="mes">Blessed day! I am Nathan, an assistant programer of the app and a student-athlete at LSGH, also grade 12
			under the STEM strand. The development of the app was very promity since it wil bring awareness to peoples
			weight and health. I am sure this app will help countless of people with their
			<i>weight loss or gain journey.</i> As an athlete, weight is very important to my day to day life but it
			<b>doesn't define who I am</b>. Do not let not getting the ideal weight drive you to losing hope. Instead,
			remember that a healthy life will surely bring happiness to you.</p>
