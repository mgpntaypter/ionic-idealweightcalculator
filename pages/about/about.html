    THE APP
  </h1>
  <div>
    <p class="maindesc">What? Hello! Curious about the supposedly ideal weight of someone your sex and height? Then, this app is for you. The app uses four different formulas, namely by Hamwi (1964), Devine (1974), Robinson (1983), and Miller (1983), in solving you ideal weight. The app calculates so fast so there is no need to go search up the formula and manually solve it. Unfortunately, we are sad to say that this app is only for accurate adults whose height is 5 feet and above. It isn’t accurate for kids and pregnant women. </p>
    <h3>So, how does it work? </h3>
    <h4>Step 1: Indicate what your sex and height is. </h4>
    <p>It is important to know your sex and height because the formulas are different for each sex and will depend on your height. In this app, we only take height values in feet and inches. Take note that height values shouldn’t be negative or the inches value shouldn’t be greater than or equal to 12. Please convert 12 inches to 1 foot.</p>
    <h4>Step 2: Press Solve.</h4>
    <p>After inputting your sex and height, simply press the green “Solve” button and the app will automatically compute your weight.</p>
    <h4>Step 3: Tada! You can see what your ideal weight should be.</h4>
    <p>The app will indicate four values on what your ideal weight is depending on which formula was used. This is summarized at the bottom of the calculator, just below solve button.</p>

    <p>Hey there! I'm Andrew and I'm the Lead Programmer of Calcuweight. I'm currently a Grade 12 student in La Salle Green Hills (LSGH) under Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) strand. Creating this app was very fun for me so I hope this brings joy in you as well. If your weight isn't ideal based on calculations, don't dwell much on this fact. Just constantly <b>remind yourself to live healthily</b> and when you do so, <i>everything</i> will come into place.</p>

    <p>Hallo! I'm Max and I'm a programmer of this app. Just like Andrew, I'm also a student in LSGH at the same grade and strand. Making this app was really fun and productive at the same time. This was really useful for me since I'm on the <i>heavy side</i> and I wanted to know what my ideal weight should be. But don't worry, if your weight is not even close with your ideal weight, <b>use this as a motivation to stay healthy.</b></p>

    <p>Blessed day! I am Nathan, an assistant programer of the app and a student-athlete at LSGH, also grade 12 under the STEM strand. The development of the app was very promity since it wil bring awareness to peoples weight and health. I am sure this app will help countless of people with their <i>weight loss or gain journey.</i> As an athlete, weight is very important to my day to day life but it <b>doesn't define who I am</b>. Do not let not getting the ideal weight drive you to losing hope. Instead,  remember that a healthy life will surely bring happiness to you.</p>
